= DESCRIPTION:
This cookbook is intended to install and configure the RightScale Self Service Vending Machine (rsss for short).

= REQUIREMENTS:
This assumes that the rsss will already be downloaded to the rsss/install_dir and that mysql and apache (with a vhost) has already been installed and configured.

Effectively, it's intended to be used as the last recipe in a boot runlist on the RightScale LAMP All-in-One.

A ServerTemplate will be released at some point when it's appropriate.
